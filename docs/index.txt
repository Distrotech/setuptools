Welcome to Distribute's documentation!
======================================

`Distribute` is a fork of the `Setuptools` project.

Distribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method for
working with Python module distributions.

For those who may wonder why they should switch to Distribute over Setuptools, itâ€™s quite simple:

- Distribute is a drop-in replacement for Setuptools
- The code is actively maintained, and has over 10 commiters
- Distribute offers Python 3 support !
