Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

Use Mercurial bookmarks or Git branches. Use incremental commits. Minimize
stylistic changes or at least submit them as separate commits.

Semantic Versioning

Setuptools follows ``semver`` with some exceptions:

- Uses two-segment version when three segment version ends in zero
- Omits 'v' prefix for tags.

.. explain value of reflecting meaning in versions.
