Release Process
===============

In order to allow for rapid, predictable releases, Setuptools uses a
mechanical technique for releases. The release script, ``release.py`` in the
repository, defines the details of the releases, and is executed by the
`jaraco.packaging <https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.packaging>`_ release
module. The script does some checks (some interactive) and fully automates
the release process.

A Setuptools release manager must have maintainer access on PyPI to the
project and administrative access to the Bitbucket project.

To make a release, run the following from a Mercurial checkout at the
revision slated for release::

    python -m jaraco.packaging.release

Release Frequency
-----------------

Some have asked why Setuptools is released so frequently. Because Setuptools
uses a mechanical release process, it's very easy to make releases whenever the
code is stable (tests are passing). As a result, the philosophy is to release
early and often.

While some find the frequent releases somewhat surprising, they only empower
the user. Although releases are made frequently, users can choose the frequency
at which they use those releases. If instead Setuptools contributions were only
released in batches, the user would be constrained to only use Setuptools when
those official releases were made. With frequent releases, the user can govern
exactly how often he wishes to update.

Frequent releases also then obviate the need for dev or beta releases in most
cases. Because releases are made early and often, bugs are discovered and
corrected quickly, in many cases before other users have yet to encounter them.

Release Managers
----------------

Jason R. Coombs is the primary release manager. Additionally, the following
people have access to create releases:
