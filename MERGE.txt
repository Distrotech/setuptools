With the merge of Setuptools and Distribute, the following concessions were
made:

Differences from setuptools 0.6c12:

Major Changes
-------------

* Python 3 support.
* Improved support for GAE.
* Sort order of Distributions in pkg_resources now prefers PyPI to external
  links (Distribute issue 163).

Minor Changes
-------------

* Wording of some output has changed to replace contractions with their
  canonical form (i.e. prefer "could not" to "couldn't").

Differences from Distribute 0.6.35:

Major Changes
-------------

* The _distribute property of the setuptools module has been removed.
* Distributions are once again installed as zipped eggs by default, per the
  rationale given in `the seminal bug report
  <http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue33>`_ indicates that the feature
  should remain and no substantial justification was given in the `Distribute
  report <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/19/>`_.
